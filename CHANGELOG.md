# Changelog

Every entry says what changed and what was measured to justify it. A number here
carries the conditions it was taken under, or it says that it is unmeasured.

This file records the **released** history. The full reasoning behind each change
is in its commit message and on its issue; this is the short version.

## 0.0.3 — 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- **The installer verified nothing, and the word was on the screen anyway.** Step 3
  was called *Verifying*: it printed the archive's SHA256 and compared it with
  nothing, and the `MANIFEST.json` in the package — a hash per file — was never
  read.

  The assumption underneath was that a damaged archive would fail to extract.
  Measured 2026-08-08: it does not. A single flipped byte inside the compressed
  stream, at three different offsets, and `Expand-Archive` extracted all three
  **without an error** and wrote the wrong bytes to disk. TLS covers the wire;
  nothing covered the file. A damaged install would have surfaced later as a DLL
  that will not load and been diagnosed as anything but a bad download.

  Verification now happens after extraction, against the manifest, file by file.
  A mismatch names the file, says the install is damaged, and exits 1 instead of
  printing the next steps. Both directions are driven end to end in the suite:
  an honest package passes, a package whose manifest disagrees with its contents
  fails.

## 0.0.2 — 2026-08-08

The first release existed for about an hour before it was installed, and both
defects it shipped were found by running it rather than by reading it.

### Fixed

- **A finished install reported exit code 255.** `& nvidia-smi … | Select-Object -First 1`
  ends the pipeline after one line, PowerShell kills the process, and
  `$LASTEXITCODE` lands on `-1`. Nothing later touched it, so the installer
  handed that back after doing everything right. Any caller checking an exit
  code read a success as a failure.
- **The install closed the user's shell.** The fix for the above put an explicit
  `exit 0` at the end. In a script file `exit` leaves the script; in a string run
  through `iex` — which is how this is installed — it leaves the **host shell**.
  The window vanished the instant the install finished, before the three
  commands it had just printed could be read.
- **The command the installer prints was missing `--jinja`.** Without it
  `llama-server` uses its own built-in template instead of the model's, the
  client's replayed reasoning is dropped, and the prompt cache breaks on every
  turn: 138.8–242.3 s of re-prefill against 1.6–2.2 s. Following the installer
  gave the slow path while following the README gave the fast one.

### Added

- **The run ends on ENTER.** A console opened for the install closes with it, and
  the model to fetch and the two commands to run appear nowhere else on screen.
  `-NoPause` for a script driving the install; skipped when the host has no
  console, because a wait nobody can satisfy is a hang.
- **`-SourceUrl`** takes an http(s) URL or a local `.zip`. An installer whose only
  source is a release can never be tried before that release is published — the
  first person to run it would be the first person to test it.
- **The last screen names the model properly**: what it is, who quantised it,
  where it lives, and the one trap measured on 2026-08-07 — `hf` reports success
  even when it reached nothing.

### Changed — the client

- **An assistant turn now carries its reasoning back into the history.** The
  chat template renders a kept turn as `<think>…</think>`, so omitting the field
  left an empty think block and the prefix diverged exactly where the thoughts
  began. Everything behind that point was re-read, however short the thoughts
  were: 48 tokens of reasoning cost 2,018 tokens of prefill. Measured across
  three task sets — dropping it re-reads 0.909–0.986 of the previous turn's
  output, replaying it re-reads 0.008–0.016. Live: turns 2 and 3 prefilled 18 and
  19 tokens where they had cost about 4,256 before. ([#60](https://github.com/nibor1896/Crow/issues/60))
- **Every request carries a one-entry `tools` array**, for the prompt cache
  rather than for the tool. This template keeps a past turn's thoughts only while
  tools are present; with none, both variants render byte for byte the same.
  A returned tool call is reported, not executed — that is
  [#58](https://github.com/nibor1896/Crow/issues/58).
- **The context bar asks the server** instead of adding `prompt_n` and
  `predicted_n`, which was wrong three times over and ran the bar *backwards*
  while the conversation grew. It reads `usage.total_tokens` now.
  ([#60](https://github.com/nibor1896/Crow/issues/60))
- **The timing line carries `cached N/M`** — how much of the prompt the server
  did not have to read again, per turn, reported rather than inferred.

### Tests

Client suite 75 → 91. Installer selftest 13 → 20, including the two cases that
cover the shell it used to close. `tools/probe-prefix-cache.py` and its suite are
new: they are the measurement behind the reasoning decision, not a description of
it.

## 0.0.1 — 2026-08-08

First package: the patched `llama-server` with the expert-streaming path, every
runtime library it needs, and the Python client. 26 files, 506.4 MB,
self-contained — the packer refuses to write an archive whose binaries import
something the archive does not carry.

Superseded within the day by 0.0.2. It installs, and then reports a failure and
closes the window.
