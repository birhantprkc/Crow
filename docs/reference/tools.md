### Delegation (#143)

Parallelism is bought at a provider, not from the card: `delegate(task)` starts a second
session on a remote spot and returns its id immediately — the local slot (`-np 1`, warm
cache) is refused as a target, hard. `subtasks()` lists where things stand; `collect(id)`
(or `collect("all")`) blocks once and returns the result. A subtask sees only what was
sent to it. Stop cancels the local turn **and** the subtasks; whatever a stream still
delivers is dropped and the card ends `interrupted`. Tokens are counted from the remote's
`usage` block — remote endpoints send no llama timings. The default spot is the free
pool's best answer, pinned only after a model answered twice in a row and carried a real
delegation; the user's own `/delegate <task>` does the same from the composer, [also
while a turn is running](../user-guide/window.md).

| release level | asks before |
|---|---|
| `auto` (default) | nothing |
| `allowedit` | executing |
| `manual` | writing and executing |

Reading never asks, at any level.
